Events
======

Unlike some other types of programs, Luacontroller programs cannot run continously.
Instead, they run whenever something (an event) happens, and an "event" table is made available with details.

Event types include:
* 'program' - Program was loaded
* 'on' and 'off' - A Mesecons pin changed on/off state
* 'digiline' (if Digilines is installed) - A Digilines message was received
* 'interrupt' - An interrupt timer reached zero
* 'terminal' - Text was typed into the terminal
