Digilines
=========

If the digilines mod is installed, then Luacontrollers can also send/receive digilines signals.

To send a digilines signal, use the digiline_send() function.
Example:
digiline_send("lcd","Hello") --Sends the message "Hello" on the channel "lcd"

Please note that digilines messages are sent from all pins, and there is no need or ability to select one.

When a digilines signal is received, an event occurs.
Example:
{
	type = "digiline",
	channel = "lcd",
	msg = "Hello"
}
