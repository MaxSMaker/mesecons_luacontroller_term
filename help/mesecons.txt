Mesecons I/O
============

Luacontrollers provide four pins for mesecons connections, labeled from A to D.
There is no need to manually switch between input and output modes - any pin not outputting mesecons power automatically works as an input.

Input states can be read from the pin table.
Example:
if pin.a then
	--Code here would be run only if pin A is active
end

Outputs can be set by writing to the port table.
Example:
port.b = true --Outputs a signal on pin B

When a pin starts or stops receiving a signal, an event occurs with some information about the pin.
Example:
{
	type = "on",
	pin = {
		name = "A"
	}
}
